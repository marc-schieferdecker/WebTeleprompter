	"DonateText": "<h2 class=\"display-4\">Hello, world!</h2>\n<p class=\"lead\">I developed this teleprompter web app in my spare time, because all the Android apps out there where not exactly what I needed or to expensive. As professional software developer (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/eisenfell\">and YouTuber</a>) I decided to create my own app.</p>\n<p class=\"lead\">So here it is and it's free for you to use. If you have any suggestions contact me: <a href=\"mailto:ms@letsshootshow.de?subject=WebTeleprompterApp suggestion\">ms@letsshootshow.de</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"lead\">If you like this peace of software I would be happy to receive a small <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=N3XHP4EAX49B8&source=url\">donation via Paypal</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"lead\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p class=\"lead\">Marc</p>",
